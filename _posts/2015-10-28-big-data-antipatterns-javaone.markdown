Yesterday I presented on big data anti-patterns to an audience at JavaOne.  It was
live-streamed (no pressure Alex) and I'm hoping the video will be publicly available shortly;
if so I'll update this post with a link.

The presentation covered seven anti-patterns ranging from fairly high-level
ones (such as "you don't have big data") to ones that were more in the weeds
(approximate counting), and covering tools such as Hadoop, Cassandra and Kafka.

Thanks to everyone who attended - I had a lot of fun presenting, and I'm looking
forward to giving more talks in the future.

Here's a link to the slides of the talk:  http://www.slideshare.net/grepalex/avoiding-big-data-antipatterns
