This blog is a bunch of HTML created by [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). I'm hosting
it on a VM, and this post is the sequence of steps that I used to setup the blog on my VM from scratch.

The instructions that follow were executed a CentOS 6 VM.

# Create an account

<pre><code>shell$ useradd bloguser
</code></pre>

# Setup some basic security

# Install and start nginx

# Install jekyll

# Create a crontab entry
