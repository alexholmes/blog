The current [HDFS Slurper](https://github.com/alexholmes/hdfs-file-slurper) was created as part of
writing "Hadoop in Practice", and it just so happened that it also happened to fulfill a need that
we had at work. The one-sentence description of the Slurper is that it's a utility that copies files
between Hadoop file systems. It's particularly useful in situations where you want to automate
moving files from local disk to HDFS, and vice-versa.

While it has worked well for us, with the addition of a few choice features it could be
even more useful:

* Filter and projection, to remove or reduce data from input files
* Write to multiple output files from a single input file
* Keep source files intact

As such I have come up with a high-level architecture for what v2 may look like (subject
to change of course).
